# IMAGE CLASSIFIER

Traffic sign recognition is a tough but cool problem for AI in transportation systems. Traffic signs come in all sorts of colors, shapes, and sometimes have pictures or text, which makes it hard to classify them. Some signs, like speed limit signs, look almost the same, adding to the challenge. Plus, the AI has to deal with changes in lighting, parts of signs being blocked, rotations, weather changes, and more. Using a big dataset of traffic signs, we'll classify them, train and test different models, and see how they stack up against multilayer perceptrons (MLPs).
